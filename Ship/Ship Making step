~Open Blender.
~Creata a new Genreal file.
~Press A(To select all) then Press X(To delete) and hit enter to delete all.

#TO MAKE A Base:

~Press Shift+A and select Cube.
~Cut its loop at the center.
~Add Mirror modifier.
~Using Move tool Select the vertices of the cibe adjust them and place them at right place to give a shape of ship.
~Using Extrude tool extrude faces and give degin to it.
~Add Cylinder to make piller.
~Then adjust its size then place them at right place.
~To make a stairs add another cube.
~To make a ship stairing add a cylinder and then using inset faces tool give finishing to it.
~Then to make a Ship sail add a Nurbe surface and then adjust ist size.
~To make a monkey Press Shift+A and then go to mesh option then there is a Monkey option then add it.
~Then place it at the front of the ship.
~When ship is completely ready then right click on it then Click on the option Smooth shape.
~Then add Landscape and place it at the side of the ocean.
~Then make copy of it then cover the ocean with lanscapes.

#TO ADD PARTICLES:

~Add a plane and then place at the front bottom of the ship and also on the back bottom  of the ship.
~Then adjust its size.
~then add mirror modifier of it.
~Then go to particle option then add particles then adjust their number and their velocity.
~Then Add a wind and place it into front of the ship.
~Adjust its strength according to particles.
~The  add a sphere.
~Go to particle setting then go to render option then change its type to object and then select the sphere as a object of particles and then adjust its render size.

#TO MAKE A ocean:

~Then add a cube then place it at bottom.
~Goto modifier tab then select subdivison modifier then increase its viewpoint.
~Then Add another modifier= Displace modifier, then increese its viewpoint and then add a volonoid texture into it and adjust its size.
~Then adjust the size of the cube according to ocean.
~Then Add a Empty cube Press N and then click in rotational X axis and change its value to -360 and then right click on it select option (add Single key frame).
~Then Select that cube as a parent of that ocean.


#COLORING:

~In right side their is a material properties toolbar click on that.
~Then their is a " + " symbol option click on that then click " New " option.
~Their is a option Viewport Display. In that option choose the color black and then select a face which i have to fill then click on the assign option.
~Then adjust roughness, surface color, surface type, etc.

~Repeat these steps to fill colors in every object.

#SET KEYFRMAS:

~Select ship.
~Then press N to open transform table.
~Then increase ro decrease the ship location at Z axis and at every change press right click on it then select the option "Insert a sigle Keyframe" and then increase the time.
~Similarly Rotate the ship at Y axis or X axis and then Insert key frames.


#CAMERA:

~Press Shift+A and then add a camera.
~Then change its type to orthographic and then adjust its focal length.

#LIGHT:

~Add a point light.
~Then aadjust its power. then place it at the side of the ship.
~then copy it then place at all corner of the ship.

#RENDERING:
~Go to output properties:
~select the total frames.
~select output as a FFMPEG video format.
~select RGB colors.
~resolution = 1920*1080
~set location to save.
~Then go to the RENDER option in the menu bar then select the render animation.
~Now all frames are in processing to render.

~~~~AFTER COMPLETING THE PROCESS GO TO THAT FILE LOCATION AND THERE IS A VIDEO OF THE OUR PROJECT.~~~~~~~
