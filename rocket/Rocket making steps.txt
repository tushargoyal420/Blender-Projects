~Open Blender.
~Creata a new Genreal file.
~Press A(To select all) then Press X(To delete) and hit enter to delete all.

#MAKING ROCKET:

~Add a cylinder.
~Adjust its thickness and size.
~then Using extrude tool extride the faces and give the shape of rocket.
~using loop cut give them loop cut the give design to them.
~Then Add another cube and place it at the side of the rocket.
~Then adjust its size and extrude its upper face then Press S and Then Shift+Z then enter 0 then press enter to make a cone at the top of the cylinder.
~Then add a sphere at the bottom of that cyliner then extrude it to make lower part of that.
~Then make copy of them and place at the side of the rocket.
~Then make rocket parent of them.
~Using Ctrl+J merge them.

#ADD FIRE AT THE BOTTOM:

~Add a Cylinder and then place at the bottom of the rocket and also the other small side parts of that rocket.
~Then adjust its size.
~Then go to particles option then add particles then adjust their number and their velocity.
~The add a sphere.
~Go to particle setting then go to render option then change its type to object and then select the sphere as a object of particles and then adjust its render size.
~Then adjust its life time according to rocket fire blast.
~Then Make rocket parent of them.

#MAKING LAUNCHPAD:

~Cut it at the center then delete one side faces.
~Then adjust it accoriding to size of the rocket.
~Then add mirror modifier to them.
~Add a cube then using inset faces make small parts into them then extrude them.
~then giving shape to them.
~Then add a plane at the bottom and resize it to fill the camera background.

#COLORING:

~In right side their is a material properties toolbar click on that.
~Then their is a " + " symbol option click on that then click " New " option.
~Their is a option Viewport Display. In that option choose the color black and then select a face which i have to fill then click on the assign option.
~Then adjust roughness, surface color, surface type, etc.

~Repeat these steps to fill colors in every object.

#SET KEYFRMAS:

~Select Rocket.
~Then press N to open transform table.
~Then increase ro decrease the Rocket location at Z axis and at every change press right click on it then select the option "Insert a sigle Keyframe" and then increase the time.
~Similarly apply same thing on the supporter of the rocket at the launchpad Y axis or X axis and then Insert key frames.

#ADJUST CAMERA AND ITS PATH:

~Select the camera and " alt+ R " to clear resolution. 
~Then place it into center. (Press N and then Set X,Y,Z= 0).
~Press Shift+A and go to curve option then add a circle.
~then similarly place it into center.
~then using S resize it, then place it outside the rocket.
~then select camera and then go to the object constraints properties then add a follow path of camera. then select that circle as a path for camera.
~Then check the follow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~Select the camera and go to object constraints properties and add a track to and then select the Rocket as a track of the camera. 
~Then check the follow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~Then select To: -Z   and Up: Y.
~Then go to camera setting change its mode to orthographic and adjust its focal length according to rocket.

#LIGHT:

~Add one point light then adjust its power.
~Place it at the side of the rocket.
~Then make copy of it and place at all corner of the rocket.

#FILL COLOR FOR RENDERING:

~Add a new screen and then open shading editor their.
~Also add another screen and open 3D viewport their and press NUM0 to open camera view.
~Now select that object which have to fill color and after selecting in the shading screen add New and then adjust the color and the other thing like Roughness, Shine, Metallic etc.
~Repeat these steps and fill the color to all the object.

#RENDERING:
~Go to output properties:
~select the total frames.
~select output as a FFMPEG video format.
~select RGB colors.
~resolution = 1920*1080
~set location to save.
~Then go to the RENDER option in the menu bar then select the render animation.
~Now all frames are in processing to render.

~~~~AFTER COMPLETING THE PROCESS GO TO THAT FILE LOCATION AND THERE IS A VIDEO OF THE OUR PROJECT.~~~~~~~
