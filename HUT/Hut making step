#TO MAKING INNER SIDE HUT: 

~Press Shift+A to add a sphere.
~Cut lower side faces of the sphere.
~Using extrudes tool make give design in the side of the sphere.
~Press Shift+A and add a Torus and place onto the shelter.

#TO MAKE TRAINGULAR SHELTER:

~Add a cube then select its Upper face and press S(ReSize) then press X=0 to make shape in trainguler.
~Go to modifiers Toolbar and add Solidify Modifier to it.
~Then adjust its thickness.
~Using Loop cuts, cut the cube into 4 or 5 parts.

~Then Place that shelter into front of the Sphere.

#TO MAKE A SIDE HOUSE ON THE HUT:

~Add A cube and place it onto side of the sphere.
~Adjust its size and using loop cuts, cut in into many parts.
~Then adjust vertex postioin and give design to it.
~Then add cube and place it at the bottom of it then resize it.
~Then using Inset faces make inset faces and extrude them make side grill in that cube.
~Then using Inset faces make inset faces and extrude them make bottom support of that cube.

#TO MAKE STAIRS:

~Add cylinder and adjust its size and then adjust its uppr and lower faces to make designs.
~Place it into front and also in back side.

#TO MAKE UPPER HOUSE:

~Add cube and place it on upper side of the sphere.
~~Adjust its size and using loop cuts, cut in into many parts.
~Then adjust vertex postioin and give shape to it.

#TO MAKE GATES:

~Add a cube and place it into uppr side small house.
~Using Extrudes tool give design to it.
~Similaly same step to make a design to make gates roof.
~Then make copy of it and place at the back side and also in fron gate of the sphere.

#TO MAKE BACK SIDE DESIGN:

~Add a cylinder then place it into back side.
~Using Loop cut, cut that Cylinder into two parts.
~Then Select left sides vertex and delete their faces.
~Goto modifiers tab, Then Add mirror modidifier.
~Then using Move tool(G) move some parts of that cylinder into X direction to make designs.
~Using Extrude tool make design into it.

#MAKING Trees, Stones And Side ground:

~Press F3 and then write sepling tree in pop window and then press enter to add a Tree.
~Place it side of the house.
~Then go to geometry options of the tree there is a option of leaves select it and then check the box Show leaves to make a leaves on the tree.
~Place that leaves at the tree.
~Make copy of it and make a line of tree at other side of the hut.
~Press Shift+A and add a Landscape into it and place it side of the road.
~Then adjust its size and place at the bottom of the hut.
~Add a sphere to make a stones and place it on the lanscape.
~Then make copies of them.
~Then Add a cube and place it into bottom to make surface.

#TO MAKE A POND:

~Then Select landscape and then select small portion and press G then move to down side.
~Then select outlines of it then move them to upper side.
~Then add a cube then place it their.
~Goto modifier tab then select subdivison modifier then increase its viewpoint.
~Then Add another modifier= Displace modifier, then increese its viewpoint and then add a volonoid texture into it and adjust its size.
~Then adjust the size of the cube according to pond.
~Then Add a Empty cube Press N and then click in rotational X axis and change its value to -360 and then right click on it select option (add Single key frame).
~Then Select that cube as a parent of that pond.

#COLORING:

~In right side their is a material properties toolbar click on that.
~Then their is a " + " symbol option click on that then click " New " option.
~Their is a option Viewport Display. In that option choose the color black and then select a face which i have to fill then click on the assign option.
~Then adjust roughness, surface color, surface type, etc.

~Repeat these steps to fill colors in every object.

#ADJUST CAMERA AND ITS PATH:

~Select the camera and " alt+ R " to clear resolution. 
~Then place it into center. (Press N and then Set X,Y,Z= 0).
~Press Shift+A and go to curve option then add a circle.
~then similarly place it into center.
~then using S resize it, then place it outside the Hut.
~then select camera and then go to the object constraints properties then add a follow path of camera. then select that circle as a path for camera.
~Then check the folow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~then select the circle and press Shift+D to make a copy of that circle and then press S to resize then place it inner side of older circle.
~Then press Shift+A and then go to empty option and select a sphere and place it at the center(X=Y=Z=0).
~Then go to object constraint properties then add a folow path of that sphere. then select that new circle.
~Select the camera and go to object constraints properties and add a track to and then select the empty sphere as a track of the camera. 
~Then check the folow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~Then select To: -Z   and Up: Y.
~Then go to camera setting change its mode to orthographic and adjust its focal length according to Hut and its boundary.
~Also add a Plane in the bottom to make base.

#LIGHTS:

~Add A point light.
~Make copy of the bezier circle of the camera.
~Decrease its size and then move it to upper direction.
~then select Light and then go to the object constraints properties then add a follow path of light. Then select that circle as a path for light.
~Then check the follow curve option then click on the animate path option.
~And increase its offset.


#FILL COLOR FOR RENDERING:

~Add a new screen and then open shading editor their.
~Also add another screen and open 3D viewport their and press NUM0 to open camera view.
~Now select that object which have to fill color and after selecting in the shading screen add New and then adjust the color and the other thing like Roughness, Shine, Metallic etc.

~Repeat these steps and fill the color to all the object.


#RENDERING:
~Go to output properties:
~select the total frames.
~select output as a FFMPEG video format.
~select RGB colors.
~resolution = 1920*1080
~set location to save.
~Then go to the RENDER option in the menu bar then select the render animation.
~Now all frames are in processing to render.
